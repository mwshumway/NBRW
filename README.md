# NBRW
Nonbacktracking random walks (NBRW). A nonbacktracking random walk is a random walk on a graph in which the walker is restricted from visiting the previous node. 

I currently research these walks with Dr. Mark Kempton and Adam Knudson in the BYU math department. This code has been incredibly helpful for modeling these walks and particulary for exploring theoretical results through numerical experimentation. 

Much of this code relies on SageMath, which has many built-in functions for graph theory.
